# Electric-Car-Problem-2h
The above problem has been solved using Python language. The logic behind our designed
algorithm is that the at every stop, the car should have charge which is twice the cost of
travelling from one particular stop to the next stop so that if the next stop is not functional, and
the car does not have enough charge to travel to the next stop, then it must have enough
charge to get back to the previous stop at least. The time complexity for the designed algorithm
is linear : O(n). As far as space complexity is concerned, we first used linked list as the data
structure for solving the problem. But upon further analysis we found that the space complexity
of the problem can be further improved if we use lists instead of a linked list. Therefore, we
again solved the problem using list data structure.
